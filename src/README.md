# CAN-Protocol
The primary Data Class is the Frame class (I'm thinking of renaming it DataFrame).
I've added as much exception handling as I can think of, it should explain the error like 95% of the time.
See the Main file for a short example of how the Frame class works.

I've elected to use Kotlin for the state classes as the inheritance structure in this case is much clearer in kotlin.
Kotlin is compatible with java and compiles to java byte-code at compile-time.
It should not affect compatibility.
# Usage
## Adding CAN Frames to the lib
Add new command IDs in their respective state class (ActiveState, ChargingState...)
Add generic IDs (that do not depend on state) in the IDs class (see start & stop as examples).
All IDs should be in the form 
```java
class some_id_class {
    public int someCommandName() {
        return state + 0b100_112_111; // put the bits here.
    }
}
```
## Using Frames
See main for an example.
Make a CAN frame using the Frame constructor. 
It takes 2 params, some ID and some data.
Use the 4 state classes as objects to access any ID you need. For example, 
- you could access the `.start()` id (which is available in all 4 states) by writing `new SomeState().start()`.
- you can access specific ids the same way `new SomeState().someCommand()`.
# Issues
- Overload Frame constructors.
- Increase max Data size above 4 bytes (? if needed)
- Add codes to IDs
